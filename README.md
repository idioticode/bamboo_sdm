# Species Distribution Modeling of Seven Woody Bamboo Species in Nepal

This repository contains all R scripts and resources related to the species distribution modeling (SDM) of **seven woody bamboo species** native to Nepal. This project is one of the pioneering studies in the field of habitat suitability modeling for bamboo species in the region.

## Study Overview

The study aimed to model both current and future potential distributions of seven bamboo species under different climate change scenarios. It used an **ensemble modeling approach** combining multiple algorithms to enhance predictive accuracy.

## 📂 Repository Contents

- `extracting_tables.R`: Extracts tabular summaries from model outputs, including species-wise suitability areas and comparison tables.
- `final_sdm_map.R`: Generates final ensemble habitat suitability maps for each bamboo species under current and future scenarios.
- `functions_only.R`: Contains reusable custom functions used across different scripts in the project.
- `modeling_script.R`: Core script for building species distribution models using ensemble techniques, must run all the functions in the file `functions_only.R` before running the scripts in this R file.
- `other_maps.R`: Produces additional maps such as binary habitat classifications and overlapping suitability layers.
- `other_plots.R`: Generates supplementary plots including response curves, variable importance, and evaluation metrics.


## Environmental Variables

Environmental predictors used include:

- **19 bioclimatic variables** from [WorldClim v2](https://www.worldclim.org)
- **Topographic variables**: elevation, slope, and aspect

## Future Climate Scenarios

Future habitat suitability was projected up to **2090** under two Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs):

- **SSP245**: Intermediate emissions scenario
- **SSP585**: High emissions scenario

Climate data for projections was derived from **five Global Climate Models (GCMs)** and ensembled to improve robustness.
